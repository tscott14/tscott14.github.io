          I am a 23-year-old technology enthusiast with a passion for developing
          software projects and managing network devices. I am proficient in
          multiple programming languages, including Java, C/C++, RustLang,
          Javascript, and HTML/CSS, as well as popular frameworks associated
          with each language. My portfolio of software projects can be found on
          my Github page.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional work, I enjoy working on Homelab
          projects, setting up dedicated devices to run my Proxmox hypervisor,
          and creating various micro-services such as my Wireguard VPS system,
          Pi-hole instance, and most importantly... my Minecraft server.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are seeking someone with extensive troubleshooting experience
          in the aforementioned languages and a strong foundation of network

        <h1 class="section-header">A little more about me...</h1>
        <p>
          I began my journey in programming over a decade ago, inspired by the
          idea of modding the popular video game, Minecraft. This led me to
          delve into the world of software development, specifically in the Java
          programming language. Through hands-on experience, I obtained a
          natural intuition for the work, quickly aquiring the mindset of a
          programmer, laying a strong foundation for my future endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my freshman year of high school, I enrolled in the only
          computer science class available, eventually progressing to an
          advanced placement course aimed at preparing students for the
          Collegeboard Advance Placement Computer Science test. Drawing from my
          earlier experiences, I excelled in this field, achieving top rankings
          in regional and state programming competitions and gaining extensive
          knowledge of the Java standard libraries. As a result, our year
          achieved the best performance in our high school's recorded history.
          With my high scores on both mock and actual AP exams, I became known
          as the go-to person for software development expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic performance was strong enough that, when our professor was
          absent for a week, I was asked to assist the substitute in helping my
          classmates with the material and assignments, earning an honorary
          reward for my efforts. Those were rewarding experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          After high school, my interests expanded to include website
          development, graphics programming with OpenGL, and game engine
          development. It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I developed an
          interest in networking, leading me to pursue courses on
          network-centric processing in my university curriculum. These courses
          have had a significant impact on my understanding of how networks
          function and the various components that comprise them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to navigate the exciting and ever-evolving world of
          technology and networking, I am eager to connect with individuals who
          share my passion and vision for the future. If you are willing to
          offer guidance, support, or collaboration in my journey to become a
          proficient leader in these fields, I wholeheartedly welcome your
          involvement. Your wisdom and mentorship would be invaluable as I
          strive to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. Please
          don't hesitate to reach out and make your presence known - together,
          we can shape the future of this industry.

            how to resolve system issues without the leasure of modern UI

            Artix, the waluwigi of the protagionist Arch. Correct? Maybe so...
            Many on the internet like to uplift Artix as the Arch Linux of the
            Arch Linux Community. This maybe true, but like an ideaogy that
            takes itself to seriously and persumes to conibalize itself, Artix
            commits pratical suicide with its ideaological rebellion to all
            things natural.
